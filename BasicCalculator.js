/*Hello, this is a program that is to take two integers from the user and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division and subtaction)
on them and output the result. There are lots of bug in the code. FIND THEM AND FIX THEM!

YOU MAY NOT MODIFY THE CODE TOTALLY TO IMPLEMENT AN EASIER SYNTAX :-)
